description: """
Mu is an OCaml module for declaring music. It provides a simple type
for representing music and combinators to define and compose it.

Music values are interpreted by renderers. Mu has built-in support for
rendering music values to MIDI files.

Mu is distributed under the ISC license. It has no dependencies.
